Project Documentation
===

<a name="editing-page"></a>Editing a page
---
Go to `System > Documentation`, view any documentation page and click the `Edit` button
in the right top corner of the screen.

In the edit form, you can add content using the WYSIWYG editor.

You can insert images, variables and widgets. Note that widgets won't always display successfully
since you are viewing the page in the backend and not in the frontend which most widgets are made
for.

<a name="renaming-page"></a>Renaming a page
---
When viewing a page, click the `Rename` button in the top right corner. Choose a unique page name.
The links to the page will be renamed accordingly.

<a name="creating-page"></a>Creating a new page
---
You create a new page by editing an existing page and adding a documentation link in this format:

    [[My new page]]

After saving, you will see a link to the page `My new page`. When you click on it you will be told
that there is no content for this page yet. Edit the new page to fill it with content.

<a name="orphan-pages"></a>Orphan pages
---
It might happen that a project documentation page does exist but no other page is linking to it. The menu link
`Orphan pages` will show you these pages so you can create links to them.

Note that only project documentation pages are listed here. Module documentation orphan pages are not listed.
